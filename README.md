# TwitterAnnalyticGraphFunctions

This repository contains javaScript functions to create analytic graphs of different types such as Bubble graphs, WordClouds and Node Edge graphs using d3 and vega libraries. These are written to use with the wso2 products of ESB , CEP , DAS with SPARK SQL and Siddhi. The first release of this dashboard that uses this functions is WSO2 Asia Conference 2016 as my internship project at WSO2 Lanka (pvt) Ltd.
